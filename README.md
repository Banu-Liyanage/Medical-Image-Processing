  <strong>🔬 Transforming pixels into medical insights — one image at a time</strong>
</p>

---

Welcome to the **Medical Image Processing** repository — a growing collection of projects, scripts, and experiments exploring the fascinating world of **medical imaging**.  

This repository started as part of the *Coursera Medical Image Processing course by MathWorks* and is now evolving into a **personal portfolio of research, implementations, and hands-on work** in the domain of healthcare imaging and analysis.

---

## 📖 Overview

Medical images such as **X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and Ultrasound** contain critical information for diagnosis and treatment. Extracting useful insights from them requires advanced processing techniques.  

This repo is a central hub for:  
- 🎨 **Image enhancement** (contrast, denoising, normalization)  
- ✂️ **Segmentation** (classical + ML methods)  
- 📊 **Feature extraction** for quantitative analysis  
- 🖼 **Visualization** (2D/3D rendering, overlays, histograms)  
- 🤖 **AI pipelines** for detection and classification (planned)  

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Preprocessing with advanced filters  
✅ Segmentation using thresholding, region growing, morphology  
✅ Feature extraction for medical insights  
✅ Visualization of results with overlays and charts  
✅ Roadmap towards deep learning integration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (R2021a or later recommended)  
- Image Processing Toolbox  
- (Optional) Deep Learning Toolbox for advanced tasks  

### Running the Code
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Banu-Liyanage/Medical-Image-Processing.git
cd Medical-Image-Processing
```
Then open MATLAB, navigate to the folder, and run the scripts.

## 📊 Example Workflows

### 🔹 Image Enhancement (X-ray)
```matlab
I = imread('data/xray.png');
I_adj = imadjust(I);
imshowpair(I, I_adj, 'montage');
title('Original vs Enhanced X-ray');
```

### 🔹 Segmentation (Brain MRI)
```matlab
I = dicomread('data/brain_mri.dcm');
bw = imbinarize(I, 'adaptive');
imshowpair(I, bw, 'montage');
title('MRI and Segmented Tumor Region');
```
